I first stumbled across SASS while watching CSS tutorial videos on Youtube. At the time I was just learning vanilla CSS and was trying to think of ways that I could apply design principles to it. I believe I was watching a video by [Coder Coder](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoderCoder) when I was first introduced to the capabilities that SASS (specifically SCSS syntax) provided. I really liked the idea of using mixins to abstract away some functionality and reduce the amount of repitition found in traditional CSS. 

So when I started practicing my CSS skills, I used SCSS wherever possible. I built several challenge projects from [FrontendMentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) and created my own SCSS-configurable and reusable animated hamburger menu icon on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/wvaviator/pen/VwrpwyR).

I continued to learn more about CSS and SCSS from Youtube creators such as [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) and from the Udemy course [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/). I learned about various design patterns used in SCSS such as [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/), which felt a litle bloated for anything other than very large projects (which I would never likely create on my own).

After learning the basics of React, I discovered NextJS and fell in love with it. NextJS seemed like the perfect all-in-one toolkit for me to develop my first fully-featured website - which was for Pals of Paws Society, a nonprofit that my wife works with. At first, after watching all the tutorials for NextJS and seeing that the most commonly used form of CSS in NextJS was CSS modules, I thought that I might have to give up SCSS. However, after reading the NextJS documentation, I learned that I could still use Sass with SCSS modules. Given that I really liked both NextJS and Sass, it seemed like a no brainer.

Now, after having developed most of the Pals of Paws Society website, I found myself getting irritated by SCSS modules. It felt like too much boilerplate for every single component to have its own module, and to have to manually link every module back to my sitewide SCSS variables file. To top it all off, I really didn't see much benefit from using SCSS over CSS anymore - aside from occasionally using mixins to shorten the boilerplate code for media queries.

What I really wanted to be able to do is to quickly work up new components all inside the same .tsx file. I found myself occasionally using JSX style attributes to quickly prototype certain styles, and only later transferring those styles to their own SCSS modules when I started cleaning up and refactoring. This aversion to boilerplate is not new to me - and I think I've decided that I would be better off using a style solution like TailwindCSS, Emotion, or Styled Components, that will enable me to quickly style up new components and keep everything clean, neat, and all in one place. However, for a larger and more complex project - one in which each component might have its own _folder_, not just its own file, I can see the benefit of using SCSS modules and would likely consider using it again in that scenario.
