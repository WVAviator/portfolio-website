Having come from programming in C# using design principles and well-structured, strongly-typed, and component-based patterns, I found Javascript to be particularly frustrating. The fact that you could assign a variable a string and then later set it to a number horrified me. I hadn't even programmed much more than a basic document query and I already deeply missed my interfaces, generics, and class scoping - not to mention the amazing intellisense and autocompletion provided by the Jetbrains Rider IDE.

Enter Typescript - a solution to _most_ of the issues I had with Javascript. I could now type my JS objects, and work with them safely knowing that any syntax errors or basic typos would flash a warning at me sometime before I tried to test it. Additionally, I now get some intellisense based on the types I'm working with, and that makes the development process much easier - even if there is a bit more setup involved anytime I want to do something simple like declare props for a React component (mainly because I set the "no implicit any" option to true). I can also use design patterns again - my favorite design pattern resource, [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru), even has examples specifically for Typescript (but not for vanilla JS, go figure). 

I learned most of what I know about Typescript from the [Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/) Udemy course by [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/), and from the Youtube series [No BS TS](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNqp92_EXZBJYFrpEzdO2EapvU0GOJ09n) by [Jack Herrinton](https://www.jackherrington.com/). Both resources have been excellent and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to learn Typescript.

I do understand sometimes why Javascript is so losely typed and why some developers like it that way - specifically when working with external APIs and converting back and forth between JSON and Javascript. It feels a bit tedious to have to work up a whole type interface for every external API call, and I often don't have all the type information, such as which fields can potentially be null. However, it always pays off in the end when I'm trying to remember the property names on a variable and the intellisense pops them up on screen for me in a nice list. 

In the backend code for Pals of Paws Society, I pulled in adoptable animal data from both Petfinder and Shelterluv APIs, and manually typed them based on their respective API documentation. Each service provided different property names and information, but I ultimately wanted to combine them both into a single type interface that had only the properties I cared about - and I did so using the adapter pattern:

I was able to perform custom logic during the conversion between types, such as converting the Petfinder-provided "breed" object into a single string that could easily be displayed on a card.

Aside from interfacing types from external APIs, another awesome use case I found for Typescript in that same project was interfacing for types that could be saved to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. The ["google-spreadsheet"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-spreadsheet) package I used to read from and write to Google Sheets (a feature requested by the organization) would only accept types of the following interface for spreadsheet row data:

Which is essentially a key-value pair to map the object to a spreadsheet row. When creating the data to store in the spreadsheet, I then used interfaces that extended this interface as a generic type argument to the functions that read and write the data. 

(Note: I used bracket notation for these interfaces as a personal preference, since I wanted the resulting spreadsheet headers to appear more human-readable and not be lowercase or camelCase).

Typescript has been great at converting Javascript into something a little more bearable in terms of how I like to program. While it has added complexity, and there's likely still a lot more I can learn about it, the amount of time that it saves me from debugging and having to remember variable names is worth it.
