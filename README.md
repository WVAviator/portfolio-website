## Developer Portfolio Website

This is the portfolio website for Alexander Durham (username WVAviator). It's
purpose is to showcase the various major projects developed and highlight
experience with the various different technologies used to develop them.

The website is built on top of the Sanity.io headless CMS that allows adding new
technologies, projects, and blog posts without additional code production moves.
Updates made in the CMS will also trigger the revalidation of existing pages
associated with each update using Sanity.io webhooks and Next.js's new manual
revalidation feature.

The site is built using the following technologies:

- Next.js
- React
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- Sanity.io

Site design, development, copy, and deployment by Alexander Durham (WVAviator).
